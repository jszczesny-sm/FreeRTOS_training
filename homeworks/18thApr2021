As a reminder please find below the task you shall prepare and push into your branch until 22nd-Apr the latest:

 - As user wants to be informed about the machine state, please prepare the function to realize simple state machine that will use existing LED control and/or printf function to tell the user that system is not available.
 - Please use existing freeRTOS task called 'Flasher'
 - Please make sure that your state machine do realize more than 3states but do not run above 5-6states as it is not really needed at the moment
 - To your state machine plese provide the drawing describing state machine together with C code
 - My advice is to use UML style for state machine description, and you can use umlet tool, that can be integrated into vscode

 Some questions:
  - What are state machines?
  - What are the ways to implement state machines in C ?
  - How do I build more complex FSM where I can have nested machines?
  - What model based design is and why knowing UML is important from this context?
